## 🚀 Features  

### 📂 High-Quality & Diverse Dataset  
PlantCareNet is trained on a **carefully curated dataset** from multiple reputable sources, ensuring comprehensive coverage of plant diseases across various species.  

- 🌾 **PlantVillage** – A widely used benchmark dataset for plant disease classification.  
- 🌿 **New Bangladeshi Crop Disease Dataset** – Region-specific images covering common crop diseases in Bangladesh.  
- 🥦 **VegNet Cauliflower Dataset** – A specialized dataset for cauliflower disease identification.  
- 🍆 **Eggplant Disease Recognition Dataset** – Focused on detecting diseases affecting eggplants.  

The dataset underwent **extensive preprocessing and augmentation** to improve model generalization, making it robust for real-world applications.  


### 🌱 Deep Learning Model: PlantCareNet  
Our project is powered by **PlantCareNet**, a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for plant disease classification. Unlike generic models, PlantCareNet is fine-tuned for **lightweight deployment**, making it suitable for mobile and edge applications. It has been trained on a diverse set of plant disease images to ensure high accuracy and robust generalization.  

- 🔹 **Custom CNN architecture** designed for plant disease identification.  
- 🔹 **Enhanced for mobile and real-time inference** with minimal latency.  
- 🔹 **Handles multiple plant species and disease categories with high precision.**

### 📱 Mobile App for Disease Detection  
The project includes an **Android-based mobile application** that allows users to detect plant diseases simply by capturing an image. The app is designed with an intuitive interface, making it accessible to farmers, researchers, and agronomists.  

- 📷 **Easy-to-use interface** – Capture or upload images of the affected plant.  
- ⚡ **Real-time disease detection** – The AI model instantly processes the images.  
- 🌿 **Actionable recommendations** – Get disease information and treatment suggestions.
- 🔍 **Ref Mode & LLM Mode** – In Ref Mode, the app provides personalized recommendations based on a reference database tailored to the detected disease, offering actionable treatment suggestions. LLM Mode utilizes GPT to provide intelligent insights, answering user queries and suggesting appropriate actions, further enhancing the user experience with AI-driven support.---

```

## Run the PlantCareNet website locally

This repository now includes a local web app for uploading a leaf photo and viewing a PlantCareNet prediction.

1. Install the app dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements-app.txt`.
2. Start the app with `python3 -m streamlit run app.py`.
3. Open the local address printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

The app uses `model.keras` and `class_names.json` from the repository root. It does not need to download the dataset to make predictions.
